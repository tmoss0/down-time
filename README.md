# Down Time

Down Time is a blog I developed using Gatsby to have a site where I can post my recent video game reviews.

It is built on Gatsby, React and utilizes Contentful CMS to host my blog posts.

The term Down Time refers to the sections in the game where there's no action and the user is free to explore the environment.
